## CPS353-01-Moon-Game
3D Software Entertainment package

# Description
In our sophomore year of college, as an introduction to Software Engineering, we created a brain-teasing 3D puzzle game using Unreal Engine. It all starts with a character who is sleeping soundly, only to wake up to realize that their teammates were just about to leave them- abandoned on the moon! Can they stop their friends in time?

In this project, we were introduced to the world of Software Engineering and working collaboratively on a relatively large project. We learnt about Git/Github, C++, Visual Scripting, Game Design, HTML/CSS, Javascript, Puzzle Design, and most importantly, how to efficienttly work collaboratively as a team.
